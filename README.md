# hello-world
A depository in which I store c programming exercises (I am in the process of learning c.)

This branch contains a c program I wrote as a coding exercise. It computes and prints out a list of prime numbers up to the 32-bit signed maximum (0x7FFFFFFF). I've been optimizing it to the best of my ability and now it happily chugs away spitting out an endless list of prime numbers.
